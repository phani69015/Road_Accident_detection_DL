## Introduction

This system leverages deep learning techniques to detect and predict road accidents from real-time traffic footage. The project evaluates the performance of 15 different deep learning models and aims to deliver a reliable and efficient solution for improving traffic safety.

Key features of the system:
- Real-time accident detection from video feeds.
- Prediction of potential accidents based on traffic patterns.
- Performance analysis of multiple deep learning models on the same dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the models includes traffic footage and accident data. The dataset contains labeled images and videos, which are processed and used for training the deep learning models.

To use the dataset:
1. Download the dataset from [[link to dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BtYMCsSr3LlsQ2oWpvLetAutMP9ln-VT/view?usp=sharing)].
2. Extract the data to the `data/` folder in the project directory.
